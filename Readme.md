### Collaborate in project ( Add to internet )

GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.

- Create account in git hosting platform ([Github](https://github.com/)/[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/)/[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/))

- Crete a [Repository](https://github.com/new) to manage your project ( Like creating project folder in internet ).

- Link remote repository with local directory or clone your repository ( Create a copy of remote repo )

```
#link remote repo with local
git remote add <remote identifier> <remote repo link> #git remote add origin https://github.com/mohammedafeef/git-tuts.git

#to clone a remote repo
git clone <remote repo link>

```
